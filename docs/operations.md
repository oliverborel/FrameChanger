# Calculate menu operations
- Incoming sensor changes:
  - What does a position represented in actor A become in actor B
  - What does a rotation matrix / quaternion represented in actor A become in actor B
  - What does a linear velocity vector .....
  - What does an angular velocity vector .....
  - Covariance??
- In each case there is an option to give the value based on current frame poses as well as to give the maths that can be used (e.g T_cfw chaining, etc...)
- Maybe also example with Eigen or TooN
